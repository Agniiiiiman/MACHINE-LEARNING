1. Real-life examples of supervised learning



A. Classification – real-life examples

1.Email Spam Detection

* Input (X): Features extracted from email text:

Number of suspicious words (“win”, “free”, “prize”)

Presence of attachments

Sender’s domain, etc.

*Output (Y): “Spam” or “Not Spam”

Model learns: Patterns of emails that are usually spam.

2.Credit Card Fraud Detection

*Input (X): Transaction amount, location, time, device used, user’s past behavior.

*Output (Y): “Fraud” or “Legit”

Model learns: What kind of transactions are abnormal compared to normal user behavior.

3.Disease Diagnosis from Medical Test Results

Input (X): Patient parameters like blood pressure, sugar level, age, cholesterol.

Output (Y): Disease present / not present (e.g., “Diabetic” or “Non-diabetic”).

Model learns: Which combination of values indicates a disease.

4.Image-based Object Recognition

Input (X): Pixel values of an image (e.g., 28×28 grayscale image → 784 features).

Output (Y): Class label like “cat”, “dog”, “car”, etc.

Model learns: Visual patterns for each object class.

B. Regression – real-life examples

1.House Price Prediction

Input (X): Area (sq ft), number of bedrooms, location, age of house.

Output (Y): House price (continuous value).

Model learns: Relationship between features and price.

2.Stock Price Prediction

Input (X): Past prices, volume, technical indicators.

Output (Y): Future price or return (numeric).

Model learns: Trends/patterns in price movement.

3.Demand Forecasting for a Product

Input (X): Month, season, marketing spend, past sales.

Output (Y): Expected sales quantity.

Model learns: How demand varies with time and marketing.

4.Salary Prediction

Input (X): Years of experience, education level, job role, location.

Output (Y): Expected salary.

Model learns: How these factors affect salary.
