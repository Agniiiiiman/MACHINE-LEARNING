1. Customer Segmentation

E-commerce websites like Amazon group customers to offer personalized recommendations.

2. Spam or Fraud Detection

Banks such as HDFC Bank detect unusual patterns in transactions.

3. Face Recognition Clustering

Apps like Google Photos automatically group similar faces.

4. Document Topic Grouping

News platforms like BBC News automatically categorize thousands of articles.

5. Product Recommendations

Clustering

K-Means is an unsupervised learning algorithm used to cluster (group) data into K distinct groups based on similarity.

It tries to:

Find K cluster centers (called centroids)

Assign each data point to the nearest centroid

Objective:
Minimize the intra-cluster distance (points inside cluster are similar).
