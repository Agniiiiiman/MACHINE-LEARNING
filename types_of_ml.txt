Types of learning that you must be familiar with as a machine learning practitioner are:

1. Supervised Machine Learning-Supervised learning is a machine learning paradigm where the model is trained using a labeled dataset.
Each training sample has an input (X) and a corresponding correct output (Y).
The goal is to learn a mapping function f : X → Y so that the model can predict outputs for unseen inputs.


2. Semi-supervised Learning-


3. Unsupervised Learning-
     Unsupervised Learning is a Machine Learning approach where the dataset has no labels.
The model tries to discover patterns, grouping, or structures on its own.
* provide input data (X), no output (y).
          A. Clustering-Grouping similar data points.
Examples:
Customer segmentation in marketing
Grouping news articles by topic
Image grouping based on similarity

Most common algorithms:K-Means Clustering,Hierarchical Clustering,DBSCAN

            B. Dimensionality Reduction

Reducing the number of features while keeping important information.

Examples:
Compressing images
Visualizing high-dimensional data
Speeding up ML models

Common algorithms:PCA (Principal Component Analysis)

      C. Association Rule Learning-Finding patterns in data (market basket analysis).

Examples:
Amazon “Frequently Bought Together”
Retail store product combinations

Common algorithms:Apriori,FP-Growth,t-SNE   
        

4. Reinforcement Learning
