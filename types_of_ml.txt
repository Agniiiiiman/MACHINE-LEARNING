Types of learning that you must be familiar with as a machine learning practitioner are:

1. Supervised Machine Learning-Supervised learning is a machine learning paradigm where the model is trained using a labeled dataset.
Each training sample has an input (X) and a corresponding correct output (Y).
The goal is to learn a mapping function f : X → Y so that the model can predict outputs for unseen inputs.


2. Semi-supervised Learning-
3. Unsupervised Learning
4. Reinforcement Learning
